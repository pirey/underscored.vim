to write variable or function names in language with snake_case convention such
as python, ruby, etc.

The plugin can be toggled in insert mode. When enabled, it will swap space with
underscore and vice versa. You can toggle it again to disable, or you can leave
insert mode, and the plugin will automatically disabled. Normal mode commands,
other buffers, and other applications are unaffected.

The default insert mode mapping is <C-G><Space>. Additionally, <C-_> is mapped
in insert mode if it is otherwise unused. <Plug>UnderscoredToggle,
<Plug>UnderscoredEnable, and <Plug>UnderscoredDisable are provided if you would
prefer to define your own maps.

The plugin is automatically disabled after leaving insert mode.
